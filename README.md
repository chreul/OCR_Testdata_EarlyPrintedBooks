# OCR_Testdata_EarlyPrintedBooks
A selection of test lines of several early printed books as well as the corresponding individual OCRopus models and mixed models.

## Data
LatinHist-98000.pyrnn.gz is a mixed OCRopus model trained on twelve Latin books printed with Antiqua types between 1471 and 1686 with a focus (ten out of twelve) on early works produced before 1600. For details about the books please see [1] . The training was performed on 8,684 lines and the best model was chosen by evaluating all resulting models on 2,432 previously unseen test lines. The lowest achieved CER was 2.92% after 98,000 training steps.

The Books folder contains seven early printed books used for evaluation in [2]. For each book we made 150 lines of GT available as well as a strong individual model (coming soon) trained on an extensive amount of lines (at least 1,500). For details about the books please see [2].

For additional GT for Latin, Greek and German Fraktur please see the [CIS OCR Testset](https://github.com/cisocrgroup/Resources/tree/master/ocrtestset).
